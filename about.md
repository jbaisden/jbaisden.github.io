My name is Jason Baisden. I'm a technologist and a perpetually curious learner. This is my blog wherein I will wax poetic about my various efforts to learn new technologies. My goal is that, somewhere in the midst of my crazed ramblings, some semblance of reasonable advice and wisdom may be gleamed.

That said, I've been in the Web Development game a while now. My primary skills include ASP.NET MVC, C#, VB.Net, Javascript, Vue JS, etc, yada, yada. In my professional life, my focus has been mostly on Microsoft technologies. If you're interested in specifics, you can see more of those details [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbaisden/).

My primary focus aside from Microsoft technologies is Vue JS.
