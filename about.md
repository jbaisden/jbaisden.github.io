My name is Jason Baisden. I'm a perpetually curious learner and aspiring Angular/Ionic/Firestore/Whatever-Else-I-Decide-To-Learn application developer. This is my blog wherein I will wax poetic about my various efforts to learn these technologies. My goal is that, somewhere in the midst of my crazed ramblings, some semblance of reasonable advice and wisdom may be gleamed.

That said, I've been in the Web Development game a while now. My primary skills include ASP.NET MVC, C#, VB.Net, Javascript, etc, etc, yada, yada. In my professional life, my focus has been mostly on Microsoft technologies. If you're interested in specifics, you can see more of those details [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbaisden/).

I figured it was time to expand on my skills and learn new things such as what all this ruckus is about Angular, NoSql, and Mobile development. Yes, I know Angular isn't the only big name JS framework out there. There's React and Vue and a hundred others, I'm sure. Even so, I've settled on Angular because the only thing worse than doing nothing is indecision. So I've decided. This blog details my adventures as I set about learning these technologies, one headache at a time.
