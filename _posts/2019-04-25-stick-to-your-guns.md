I'm going to tell you a story. Let me know if it sounds at all familiar.

There was once a developer that set out to learn something new. After deliberating, questioning, forum seeking, and praying, he finally chose what to learn and began the long trek through the desert of confusion where, at the journeys end, he hoped to achieve understanding of this new art.

He was given this simple direction at the start of his journey: stay on the path. Many have gone before you and you must follow only the deepest footprints, for those are the ones set long ago by the ambitious that did not stray. And those that did stray rarely found their way back to the path. They wandered across many paths, but were doomed never to complete any of them.

This is exactly how learning something new feels. It's rather remarkable because it feels this way every, single time. It doesn't matter the technology or the framework. It's a pattern of learning whose roots seem embedded in the human condition. 

Maybe that was a tad melodramatic, but the point still remains: if you don't stick with your goals, you're going to be wandering for a long, long time. Even when you are sticking with your goals, forums will endlessly debate the merits of one bit of tech over another or loudly proclaim the thing you've set to learn will be obselete in a month - you should learn this other thing instead!

That's how I'm feeling about Angular. Not that it'll be obselete. I've no doubt that it's going to be around a long, long time. It's rather I feel that a new Javascript Framework pops up every month or so and it's hard to not get at least a little curious. And then get at least a little depressed about the shear amount of stuff out there and how little of it you know. 

Even with Angular, I'm finding that the more I learn, the more I see just how little I know. But that's the learners paradox isn't it?

So, my advice to both you and myself is to stick to your guns. Keep on the path you've set. Be bullish. Be diligent. Be doggedly determined to not be moved.
