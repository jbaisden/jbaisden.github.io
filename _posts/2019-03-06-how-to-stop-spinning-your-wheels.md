How long does it take the average developer to pick up a new language or framework? How long did it take you? Did you stick with it or bow out after a few bouts of effort and a large heaping of frustration?

I know I have. Not just once or twice, but several times over to the point where each failure lead to a bout of depression and imposter syndrome. I've been a developer for 14 years. I have picked up new technologies, but mostly, I've stuck with my day job and learned the things I needed to use there and left things at that.

Now that I've reached the point where I am bloody determined to pick up some new technologies and make something beyond the tools I use every day at my day job, I wanted some way to prove to myself that I am actually gaining ground. So much of the work we do as developers is learning. And most of that learning
takes place in our heads until it finally culminates in a project of somekind. I wanted proof for myself that even though I might have spent a whole evening reading blogs, I am still being a good steward of my time and my skills.

The solution, as it turns out, is surprisingly simple: **keep a journal**. 

I've been doing this for about 2 weeks now and have developed a few rules.

 - Keep it simple. This is a "just the facts" briefing of what was done.
 - **DO NOT** use it for taking notes on tutorial videos or other coursework. This will lead to clutter. Besides, I've found OneNote to be superb for note taking. 
 - If you visit a blog, log it. If you finished a video in a course, log it.
 - Be concise, yet clear so that you can pick up whereever you've left off in your endeavors.
 
Emperically speaking, the benefits I've taken from this practice are:

- Clear evidence of effort expended
- Track record of what you were thinking at the time of an entry
- Data that can clearly show where your efforts are proving productive, where you're spinning your wheels, and where course correction is needed or was previously taken.
