I've found the hardest thing for me to do as a programmer is forgive myself. That's a shame because the ability to do this is so paramount to the all around betterment of a developer.

Think about what we do for a living:

Code. Test. Debug. Repeat. 

Technical savants aside, our betterment comes through a cycle of failures until arriving at a success. Then we repeat the process.

We, as programmers, solve problems. Problems can have hundreds of solutions. Seeing those few perfect solutions and separating that from the myriad of others ranging from bad to outright evil is absolutely impossible for me to do in my head. So, like in a game of pick up sticks, we grab one of the solutions. Solve the problem. And then evaluate how effectively the problem was solved. It's a cycle of problem solving wherein we are finding and creating a solution, regardless of efficiency, and gradually refining the solution until we derive one that is the most capable we can create. 

I'm waxing poetic here because, as I've set out to learn Angular, I've found this particular cycle of "problem to solve" to "some solution that's probably really, really bad, but at least works" to "something better than the previous solution, but can still be improved" to "a solution I can at least not loose sleep over" has become ever present in my thoughts and struggle to pick up this technology. Mind you, it's not that it's particularly hard perse, but rather its going from 20+ hours of tutorial videos and code alongs to creating my own project from scratch requires the knowledge to cement itself in a much more real manner. 

I have to constantly remind myself to simply trust the process. There will be confusion. There will be frustrations. There might even be tears. Yet, through it all, every failure is a step toward success and every bit of confusion a step towards understanding. It may take time, but by constant perseverence, excellence will be achieved.
