I've found the hardest thing for me to do as a programmer is forgive myself. That's a shame because the ability to do this is so paramount to the all around betterment of a developer.


Think about what we do for a living:

Code. Test. Debug. Repeat. 

Technical savants aside, our betterment comes through a cycle of iterative failure. And, when you consider it, we're just mimicking the cycle of life found nearly everywhere in nature. 

Perhaps this issue goes beyond an inability to forgive ones self and marches right into the path of hubris. Ironically if I was asked what my greatest fault as a person was, I would not, in a million years, have claimed hubris. I am always seeking a more efficient solution to any problem I'm solving. 

Let me breakdown exactly what I mean in case I've lost you or you're not a programmer yourself.

We as programmers solve problems. Problems can have hundreds of solutions. Seeing those few perfect solutions and separating that from the myriad of others ranging from bad to outright evil is absolutely impossible for me to do in my head. So, like in a game of pick up sticks, we grab one of the solutions. Solve the problem. And then evaluate how effectively the problem was solved. It's a cycle of problem solving wherein we are finding and creating a solution, regardless of efficiency, and gradually refining the solution until we derive one that is the most capable we can create. 

Over time we notice patterns that the optimal solutions we've encountered previously all have in a common. These become building blocks in our toolbox of problem solving. 

I'm waxing poetic here because, as I've set out to learn Angular, I've found this particular cycle of "problem to solve" to "some solution that's probably really, really bad, but at least works" to "something better than the previous solution, but can still be improved" to "a solution I can at least not loose sleep over" has become ever present in my thoughts and struggle to pick up this technology. Mind you, it's not that it's particularly hard perse, but rather its going from 20+ hours of tutorial videos and code alongs to creating my own project from scratch requires the knowledge to cement itself in a much more real manner. 

Never-mind the general noise that parades itself in my brain when I think about not just what I'm trying to learn, but also berating myself for time lost,  the many development frameworks I could/should also be learning, and the constant not-knowing if the thing I'm learning today will be relevant or, as relevant, tomorrow.
