I've been keeping a learning journal as I've set out to learn Angular and other adjacent technologies. I gotta say, I'm rather proud of myself. It seems that my journal is accomplishing it's purpose of not letting me putter out of steam and fade away from my goal. 

To date I have entries spanning from February through most of March and into April. To that end, I'm actually in the process of creating my first real Angular application where I hope to move these journals online. Truth be told, it's already over-engineered as heck, but it's a fabulous learning experience to put to use the things I've learned and also channel the tagential learning needed.

So, with all of that said, I think the discipline of celebrating your victories is just as important as learning from failures. We all meet our goals one step at a time. It's a healthy thing to look back once and a while and think to yourself "Wow...I've covered a lot of ground. That's awesome!"
