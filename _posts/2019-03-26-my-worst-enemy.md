So...it's been a while since I posted. I got sick. Then I lost momentum in learning. Things 
are a bit stale in my brain at the moment. I'm already fighting anxiety that I'm reverting back to my
old habit of running away/burying my head in a game when the learning gets hard. I know
in my head that I have to push through this.

It's hard, though. There's so much to learn. So many dozens of practices I either should be 
using or feel I ought to know. So much time wasted and so much time hating myself for having
done so. And all of this leading to me being my own worst enemy self-esteem wise.

Okay. So I said it. It's out there. Now time to try and pick up the pieces and keep moving forward.
